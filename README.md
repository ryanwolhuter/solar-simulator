# Solar Simulator

A simulation of our inner solar system, based on [this](https://css-tricks.com/creating-your-own-gravity-and-space-simulator/) awesome tutorial.

## How to Use

Choose which celestial body you'd like to add to the simulation from the drop-down menu.

You can either click anywhere on the screen to add it at a zero initial velocity, or click and drag to draw a line which will dictate the initial velocity and direction of the mass that you add.

## Features

I improved on the original tutorial by giving each celestial body it's own unique radius and color. These are scaled according to NASA's data. The color choices also come from NASA.

I also added my favorite black hole: [Cygnus X1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_X-1)
